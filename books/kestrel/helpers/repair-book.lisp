(in-package "ACL2")

;; STATUS: Working prototype

;; SETUP:
;;
;; 1. To enable repairs based on information saved during successful proofs,
;; turn on saving of event data during certification by setting the value of
;; the ACL2_WRITE_EVENT_DATA environment variable to "t".
;;
;; Example: export ACL2_WRITE_EVENT_DATA=t
;;
;; To maximize the benefit of this change, recertify all books after setting
;; ACL2_WRITE_EVENT_DATA.
;;
;; 2. To cause repairs to be attempted automatically whenever cert.pl fails to
;; certify a book, set the ON_FAILURE_CMD environment variable to the location
;; of the repair-book-from-cert-pl.sh script in this books/kestrel/helpers/
;; directory.
;;
;; Example: export ON_FAILURE_CMD=~/acl2/books/kestrel/helpers/repair-book-from-cert-pl.sh

;; TODO: Add support for repairs that involve failures to translate
;; terms/hints/etc. possibly due to missing names.

;; TODO: Add support for determining what changed (e.g., by doing a git diff).

;; TODO: When searching for all failed books, handle cert.pl output that is directed to another dir.
